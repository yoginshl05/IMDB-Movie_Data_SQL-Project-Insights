# IMDB-DATASET- RSVP MOVIES - SQL PROJECT (DATA ANALYSIS)
This is a SQL Project on IMDB Data Set - To find the valuable insights from the data set to answer the important questions!!

# Problem Statement
RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. This project include the IMDB Data Set, Question script with all necessary questions to answer and also sample anwers for each question(so it is easy for the analyst to know exactly how the output is desired from the projesct).

Lets discuss the stepwise approch taken to complete this project for IMBD Data Set.
# Data Set & Creation of Database:
1. First step is to download the Data Set and create a database in MySQL Workbench. if you do not want to write the DDL & DML commands to create the Database, we have included a file which can be directly copied to create a databse.
2. Now, we have created a database, added Tables in Database, Connected of all tables to one another along with the help of Primary & Foreign Keys, inserted values in all the tables to accomplish the overall Database Creation with the name of "movies".

# Analysis of Database to extract meaningfull insights:
1. We have included a question script, included all the necessary questions to answer our main problem: Release of movie from RSVP movies for global audience.
2. Once Database is created, go on to create an ERD(Entity Relationship Diagram) to view to relationship of tables with one another and also the type of relationships as well along with Primary & Foreign Keys.
3. Now, we proceeded with taking one question at a time and writing the DML commands to get desired output for each question in Question Script.

# Conclusion:

We have included a PDF file with final conclusion for RSVP movies to create a movie for global audience taking in consideration and providing answers for following variables:- actor, actoress, production house, duration, director, language, votes etc...
